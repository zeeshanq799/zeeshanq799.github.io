    question: "How much does YouTube pay for Shorts per 1,000 views in 2026?",
    answer: "YouTube Shorts typically pay between $0.01 and $0.10 per 1,000 views, with most creators earning around $0.03–$0.05 RPM. Tier 1 countries (USA, UK, Canada) see higher RPM, occasionally reaching $0.15 for high-value niches like finance or tech."
  },
  {
    question: "What is YouTube Shorts RPM in 2026?",
    answer: "YouTube Shorts RPM (Revenue Per Mille) in 2026 ranges from $0.01 to $0.15 depending on audience geography and niche. Average Shorts RPM is approximately $0.03–$0.05 globally. This represents revenue after YouTube's platform cut."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do YouTube Shorts earn less than long-form videos?",
    answer: "Shorts earn less because YouTube uses a revenue pooling model instead of direct ad placements. All Shorts ad revenue goes into a pool and is distributed based on your share of total Shorts views. Additionally, Shorts have shorter watch time."
  },
  {
    question: "Do Shorts views count toward monetization?",
    answer: "Yes. Shorts views count toward the 10 million public Shorts views requirement for YouTube Partner Program eligibility. However, Shorts watch time does not count toward the 4,000 hours needed for long-form monetization."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I monetize Shorts without 1,000 subscribers?",
    answer: "No. You still need 1,000 subscribers to join the YouTube Partner Program. Once eligible, you can monetize both Shorts and long-form content under the same channel monetization."
  },
  {
    question: "What affects Shorts RPM?",
    answer: "Shorts RPM is influenced by viewer geography (Tier 1 countries pay more), content niche (finance/tech typically higher), and overall advertiser demand."
  },
  {
    question: "How many Shorts views do I need to make $1,000?",
    answer: "At an average Shorts RPM of $0.05, you would need approximately 20 million views to earn $1,000. This is significantly higher than long-form content, where you'd need only 250,000-500,000 views to earn the same amount."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is this Shorts calculator?",
    answer: "Results are estimates based on industry-reported Shorts RPM benchmarks. Actual earnings depend on your specific audience demographics, geographic distribution, and niche."

          <h2>How Much Do YouTube Shorts Pay Per 1,000 Views?</h2>
          <p>On average, YouTube Shorts RPM ranges between <strong>$0.01 and $0.10 per 1,000 views</strong>, depending on viewer country, audience demographics, and advertiser demand. Compared to long-form videos, Shorts typically earn significantly lower ad revenue per view.</p>
          <p>This happens because Shorts use a revenue pooling system. YouTube collects all Shorts ad revenue and distributes it based on your share of total Shorts views across the platform. Long-form videos, in contrast, place ads directly in your content, resulting in 20-80x higher RPM.</p>

          <div className="highlight-box">
            <h3 className="mt-0">💡 Real Shorts Example</h3>
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Tech Shorts channel with 500,000 daily views, $0.05 RPM, US-based audience</p>
            <p><strong>Step 1: Calculate Monthly Views</strong><br />500,000 views &times; 30 days = <strong>15 million views per month</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Step 2: Calculate Monthly Revenue</strong><br />Formula: (Monthly Views / 1,000) &times; RPM<br />(15,000,000 / 1,000) &times; $0.05 = <strong>$750 per month</strong></p>
            <p className="mb-0"><strong>Comparison with Long-Form:</strong><br />Same 500K daily views with long-form at $4.00 RPM = <strong>$60,000 per month</strong><br />That&apos;s 80x more revenue from the same view count.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>Why Shorts Pay So Much Less</h2>
          <p>Three fundamental differences explain the massive RPM gap between Shorts and long-form content:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Revenue Pooling System:</strong> Unlike long-form videos where ads appear directly in your content, Shorts revenue is pooled together and distributed based on your share of total Shorts views platform-wide. This dramatically reduces per-view earnings.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch Time Value:</strong> A 30-second Short generates far less ad inventory than a 10-minute video with multiple mid-roll ads. Advertisers pay based on attention and engagement, making longer content more valuable.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Ad Inventory:</strong> Shorts can only show ads between videos in the feed, not within the content itself. This limits monetization opportunities compared to long-form videos with pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll ad placements.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>When to Focus on Shorts</h2>
          <p>Despite lower RPM, Shorts serve specific strategic purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Channel Growth:</strong> Shorts help new channels reach 1,000 subscribers faster. They&apos;re easier to produce and get distributed more aggressively by the algorithm.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Testing:</strong> Test video concepts quickly. If a Short performs well, expand it into long-form content where RPM is 20-50x higher.</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Funnel:</strong> Use Shorts to drive viewers to your long-form content, affiliate links, or digital products where margins are higher.</li>
            <li><strong>Volume Strategy:</strong> If you can produce 5-10 Shorts per day, the accumulated views can still generate meaningful revenue at scale.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Shorts Monetization Requirements</h2>
          <p>To monetize Shorts through the YouTube Partner Program in 2026, you need:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> AND</li>
            <li><strong>10 million public Shorts views</strong> in the past 90 days OR</li>
            <li><strong>4,000 watch hours</strong> from long-form content in the past 12 months</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once approved, both Shorts and long-form videos are monetized under the same partnership. Note that Shorts views count toward the 10 million view threshold, but Shorts watch time does <strong>not</strong> count toward the 4,000-hour requirement for long-form monetization.</p>

          <h2>Maximize Your Shorts Revenue</h2>
          <p>While you can&apos;t dramatically increase Shorts RPM, you can optimize for better results:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Target Tier 1 Audiences:</strong> Create content in English for US/UK/Canada viewers. This can double or triple your RPM compared to developing markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on High-Value Niches:</strong> Finance, tech, and business Shorts tend to have higher RPM than entertainment or lifestyle content.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversify Beyond Ads:</strong> Use Shorts as a funnel to affiliate links, sponsorships, or digital products. Most successful Shorts creators earn 70%+ of income from non-ad sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine with Long-Form:</strong> Use Shorts for discovery and growth, then convert viewers to long-form content where you earn 30-80x more per view.</li>
          </ul>
