            <h2>Average YouTube Earnings Per 1,000 Views (2026 Data)</h2>

            <p>
                Earnings depend primarily on <strong>RPM (Revenue Per Mille)</strong>, not just views.
                RPM = what you actually receive after YouTube takes its share.

            <h2>How Much Does YouTube Pay in the USA vs Other Countries?</h2>

            <p>
                Audience location dramatically affects earnings.
                Tier 1 countries attract higher advertiser bids.
            </p>

            <h3>Estimated RPM by Country (2026)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>USA:</strong> $8 – $20+</li>
                <li><strong>UK:</strong> $7 – $16</li>
                <li><strong>Canada:</strong> $6 – $14</li>
                <li><strong>Australia:</strong> $7 – $15</li>
                <li><strong>India:</strong> $0.80 – $3</li>
                <li><strong>Pakistan:</strong> $0.50 – $2</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>RPM vs CPM (Important Difference)</h2>

            <p>
                Many creators confuse CPM and RPM.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>CPM:</strong> What advertisers pay per 1,000 ad impressions</li>
                <li><strong>RPM:</strong> What YOU earn per 1,000 views after YouTube’s cut</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                YouTube typically keeps 45% of ad revenue.
                So a $20 CPM does NOT mean you earn $20.
            </p>

            <h2>Does YouTube Pay the Same for Shorts?</h2>

            <p>
                No. Shorts revenue comes from the Shorts revenue pool,
                and RPM is typically lower than long-form videos.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shorts RPM often ranges from $0.02 to $0.20 depending on region.

                    <h3 class="faq-question">How much does YouTube pay per 1,000 views in 2026?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        In 2026, YouTube typically pays creators between $2 and $12 per 1,000 views based on RPM
                        (Revenue Per Mille). Earnings can range from $1 to $25+ depending on niche, audience country,
                        watch time, and advertiser demand. Finance and business channels usually earn the highest RPM.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How much does YouTube pay per 1,000 views in the USA?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        YouTube creators with a United States audience generally earn between $8 and $20+ per 1,000
                        views.
                        Finance and investing channels often exceed $15 RPM due to strong advertiser competition in the
                        US market.
                        Earnings depend on niche, watch time, ad placement, and audience engagement quality.
                    </p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How much does YouTube pay for 1 million views?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Earnings for 1 million views depend entirely on RPM. At a $3 RPM, creators earn around $3,000.
                        At a $10 RPM, earnings reach $10,000. High-RPM finance or business channels can generate $15,000
                        or more
                        for 1 million views, especially with a Tier 1 audience like the USA or UK.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">What is the difference between RPM and CPM on YouTube?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        CPM (Cost Per Mille) is what advertisers pay per 1,000 ad impressions, while RPM (Revenue Per
                        Mille)
                        is what creators actually earn per 1,000 views after YouTube’s revenue share. RPM is always
                        lower than CPM
                        because YouTube keeps approximately 45 percent of advertising revenue before paying creators.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">Does YouTube pay the same for Shorts?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        No. YouTube Shorts earnings are calculated through a shared revenue pool model and typically
                        result
                        in lower RPM compared to long-form videos. Shorts RPM often ranges from $0.02 to $0.20 depending
                        on region,
                        advertiser demand, and total Shorts performance within the revenue pool.

                    <h3 class="faq-question">What affects how much YouTube pays per 1,000 views?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        YouTube earnings per 1,000 views are influenced by niche, audience country, watch time,
                        advertiser competition,
                        video length, number of mid-roll ads, and overall engagement rate. Tier 1 audiences such as the
                        USA, UK, Canada,
                        and Australia typically generate higher RPM compared to developing markets.
